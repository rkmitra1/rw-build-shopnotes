## What I want to build

Simple Shopping List App. Allows multiple stores with lists of multiple items.

While there are multiple ways to manage a shared shopping list, part of this app's UX is that it will work on any browswer/os platform and does not require the user to use any proprietary software or services.

## Why I want to build it

Rather than a complicated app solving an unique problem, I want this app to illustrate an everyday use elegantly solved by RedwoodJS.

## More Detailed Description

A user can add one or more cards (i.e. stores) and then add one or more list items to each card.

Items can be checked off (i.e. purchased) and then deleted.
Cards can be deleted.

### Features

- Easy to use
- No instructions needed
- SPA (single page app)
- Can be hosted on the JAMStack with minimal effort

### Simple to use

- No login required
- No user accounts
- No authentication
- Yser can do most operations from a single page

### Known Limitations/Left out

- No authentication
My intent is that anyone with the link can use the app. A developer can easily add authentication and user accounts for their project.

- Left out add on features
Additional features can easily be added. These features should match a particular developer's use-case.

## Background (What made you decide to build this particular app? What inspired you?)

We are all familiar with "Hello World!" and "blog" examples for evaluating new frameworks.

This is a more useful app that a developer can continue use.

I want to illustrate how wonderful it is to use RedwoodJS. A developer cloning this app can easily extend it to add more features.

It would be awesome to have a step by step tutorial on building this app (like RedwoodsJS's tutorial). But matching the great RedwoodJS tutorial is a tall order (and nobody can match Rob cameron's original video of the tutorial).

## How will you utilize RedwoodJS?

Full RedwoodJS stack.

- Deployable to any of the supported hosting providers
- Use postgresql database

## Additional Resources/Info

- responsive
- taiwindcss
